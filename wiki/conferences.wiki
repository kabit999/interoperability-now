==Localization World Seattle 2012==
  * Although there is no official IN! presentation in Seattle, several members of the IN! and LINPORT teams will be attending and/or presenting on other topics. We are planning to host at least one informal session on IN! for people implementing, or planning to implement TIPP/Linport. IN! attendees include the following:
    * Sven Christian Andrä (ONTRAM Inc)
    * Bob Willans (XTM International)
    * Jörg Shütz (Bioloom)
    * Chase Tingley (Spartan Software)
    * Peter Reynolds (Kilgray)
Alan Melby and Arle Lommel from Linport will also be attending, so it's a great opportunity to learn about the big picture of localization interoperability.
