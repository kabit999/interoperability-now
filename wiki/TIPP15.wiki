= What's new in TIPP 1.5 =

Most of the changes in TIPP 1.5 are the result of our ongoing work with the [http://linport.org Linport Project].
  * The completely free-form section model of version 1.4 has been dialed back to a more restrained approach.  Valid section types are now enumerated by the schema; custom task types should either use an existing section type, or place files within a reserved "Custom".  Task types can still specify whether a given section type is required or optional for a that task, as well as what behavior is expected concerning its contents.
  * Additional response messages have been added, replacing the single "Failure" value with several possible failure modes.
  * New section types for terminology and metrics data.
  * Rewritten language on compliance.
  * Many clarifications and corrections to the text of the specification itself.

= What's left to do? =

There are a few things we're still trying to tackle in the 1.5 timeframe.
  * A system for referencing remote resources from a package Manifest, rather than requiring all objects to be stored inline.
  * Answering unresolved questions about TIPPs with multiple target languages.
  * Fully specify the use of XML-DSIG to authenticate packages.
