#summary Interoperability Now! joint info session with XLIFF TC members, February 1, 2012

*Attendees:* David Filip, Andrzej Zydron, Bryan Schnabel, Christian Lieske, David Walters, Helena Shih Chapman, Kevin O'Donnell, Lucia Vazquez, Micah Bly, Peter Reynolds, Chase Tingley, Andrew Pimlott

== Notes ==
  * This is not an official meeting.
  * IN! provides a short overview of their work.
  * Discussion of the relationship between XLIFF 2.0 and xliff:doc
    * Desire by both sides for features in xliff:doc to make their way to XLIFF 2.0.  But what's the best way?
    * David's preferred method is for an IN! rep to join the TC to push features through.  Discussions over who this would be.  Micah has had trouble getting Medtronic's lawyers to approve the OASIS IP waiver.
      * David offers to help Micah find a champion on the TC if he can't join OASIS
    * Christian asked: when XLIFF 2.0 is done, will xliff:doc still be needed?  Or are they still focusing on slightly different things?
  * XLIFF 2.0 timeline
    * Bryan: if XLIFF 2.0 takes more than another year, I consider it a failure.
      * However, the development is milestone-driven rather than calendar driven.
  * Interoperability focus in 2.0?
    * Bryan: we recognize that extensibility is a double-edged sword.  Some implementers ignored core 1.2 features and implemented extensions instead. 
    * They could remove extensibility or limit it somehow.  
    * Bryan likes the idea of their being a "right", non-optional way to do certain things.
    * David notes that getting good industry representation is key to ensuring this.
