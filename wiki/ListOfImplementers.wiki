And it's the living proof that real collaboration can happen between translation technology providers!" Sven C. Andrä (Founder and CEO) ||

|| [http://www.gala-global.org/files/webfm/memberlogos/656fcdd4_Yamagata_web_logo.gif] || [http://www.yamagata-europe.com Yamagata Europe] || Yamagata Europe is an ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified documentation solutions company with expertise across a broad range of industries including information technology, automotive, consumer electronics, agricultural and construction. || Deployed! || "We implemented a TIPP export from within Sitecore CMS. Packages are dropped onto an FTP and then imported into memoQ using the API. Analysis results are also imported into our own ERP to create POs and Invoices." ||
|| [http://www.gala-global.org/files/webfm/memberlogos/image002.jpg] || [http://www.aranchodoc.com/ Arancho Doc] || With a combined experience of over 30 years experience in the language services industry, Arancho Doc has always been at the forefront of the latest developments in language technology and tools. Arancho Doc serves industry leaders worldwide thanks to a network of 10 offices located throughout Europe and Asia. || Planned || "We are planning to use TIPP to streamline our translation workflow, by downloading TIPPs from our client's online-only TMS, importing them into our translation project management/workflow tool, and translating them in our offline translation environment (memoQ)." ||

|| || [http://www.medtronic.com Medtronic, Inc.] || Medical Devices/Life Sciences || In Progress || TMS <> Offline Editor Integration: We are using the TIPP task type of translate-strict-bilingual to allow our external language resources (MLVs and SLVs) to download a package from our XTM server that they can translate in memoQ (offline). The package they download includes a full preview, TM matches, TB matches (per TU!), and more. The advantage for us is that we can be confident they see all the TM and TB matches they would see if they were accessing the online TMS directly, and when they return the package to us, all the revision history, TU statuses, notes, and match rate information is transferred back into XTM without any information loss. The advantage to the translators is that they can use their favorite editor offline, or edit online with XTM, without losing functionality, and without wasting time on conversions and workarounds. Expected deployment: Q4CY12 ||
|| || || || In Progress || TMS <> QA Checker Integration: We are using the TIPP task type of translate-strict-bilingual to automate a translation QA check between XTM and an internally maintained QA Checking tool. At the appropriate point in the workflow, XTM generates a TIPP package and sends a request to the QA server to check it. The QA server processes the TIPP, runs a QA Check, and embeds the results into each affected TU in the TIPP's XLIFF:doc payload. XTM reads the TIPP response back in, and presents results to linguists, and also stores a copy of the XLIFF:doc as evidence of the check. Expected deployment: Q4CY12 ||
|| || || || In Progress ||  CMS <> TMS Integration: We will use the TIPP task type of translate-native-format to extract files for translation from an XML-based CMS, and to populate it with completed translations. Expected deployment: Q2CY13 ||
