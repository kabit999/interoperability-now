<div align="center"><h2>VERNE'S TITLE</h2></div>
<p>The French title of this novel is <i>Vingt mille lieues sous les mers</i>.
This is accurately translated as Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
the SEAS&mdash;rather than the SEA, as with many English editions.
Verne's novel features a tour of the major oceans, and the term Leagues
in its title is used as a measure not of depth but distance.  Ed.</p>
